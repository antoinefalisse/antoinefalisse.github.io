I am a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University, working with <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/scott-delp">Prof. Scott Delp</a> and affiliated with the <a href="https://nmbl.stanford.edu/">Neuromuscular Biomechanics Lab</a>. I am broadly interested in identifying and quantifying human movement abnormalities in order to design innovative treatments and rehabilitation protocols. For this purpose, I use biomechanical modeling, nonlinear optimization, machine/deep learning, and omputer vision. Prior to joining Stanford, I graduated from KU Leuven (Belgium) working with <a href="https://gbiomed.kuleuven.be/english/research/50000737/groups/HMB/People/People/00015567">Prof. Ilse Jonkers</a> and <a href="https://gbiomed.kuleuven.be/english/research/50000737/groups/HMB/People/People/00046458">Prof. Friedl De Groote</a>.

The main project of my postdoc has been the development of <a href="https://opencap.ai">OpenCap</a>, a new software package to quantify human movement from smartphone videos. OpenCap combines computer vision, deep learning, and biomechanical modeling and simulation to estimate the kinematics (motion) and kinetics (forces) of movement. OpenCap is free to use for academic research, you can find more details in the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.07.499061v1">preprint</a> of our paper.
