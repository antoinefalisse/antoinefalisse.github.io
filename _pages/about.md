I am a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University, working with <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/scott-delp">Prof. Scott Delp</a> and affiliated with the <a href="https://nmbl.stanford.edu/">Neuromuscular Biomechanics Lab</a>. In my research, I actively seek to identify and quantify human movement abnormalities in order to design innovative treatments and rehabilitation protocols. For this purpose, I use biomechanical modeling, nonlinear optimization, machine/deep learning, and computer vision. Prior to joining Stanford, I graduated from KU Leuven (Belgium) working with <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00015567">Prof. Ilse Jonkers</a> and <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/nl/person/00046458">Prof. Friedl De Groote</a>. My long-term goal is to be positioned at the intersection of innovative research and real-world applications to drive the maximum impact from my work.

The main project of my postdoc has been the development of <a href="https://opencap.ai">OpenCap</a>, a software package to quantify human movement from smartphone video. OpenCap combines computer vision, deep learning, and biomechanical modeling and simulation to estimate the kinematics (motion) and kinetics (forces) of movement. OpenCap builds on top my PhD research that aimed to develop numerical methods and models to generate computationally efficient simulations of human movement for clinical applications. OpenCap is free to use for academic research and has been adopted by a broad community of users (over 1500 single users in the last six months) from various fields including biomechanics, neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and sport science. 

To help turn this research project into real-worl applications that have an impact on people's life, I also co-founded <a href="https://www.modelhealth.io/">Model Health, Inc</a>. Example applications I work on with Model Health are physical assessments post-surgery/injury to inform physical therapists and clinicians about the health status of their patients.
