I am a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University, working under the supervision of <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/scott-delp">Prof. Scott Delp</a> and affiliated with the <a href="https://nmbl.stanford.edu/">Neuromuscular Biomechanics Lab</a>. I am broadly interested in identifying and quantifying human movement abnormalities in order to design innovative treatments and rehabilitation protocols. For this purpose, I use biomechanical modeling, nonlinear optimization, machine learning, and data from various sources (wearables, videos, medical images). Prior to joining Stanford, I graduated from KU Leuven (Belgium) working with <a href="https://gbiomed.kuleuven.be/english/research/50000737/groups/HMB/People/People/00015567">Prof. Ilse Jonkers</a> and <a href="https://gbiomed.kuleuven.be/english/research/50000737/groups/HMB/People/People/00046458">Prof. Friedl De Groote</a> in the <a href="https://gbiomed.kuleuven.be/english/research/50000737/groups/HMB">Human Movement Biomechanics Research Group</a>.
