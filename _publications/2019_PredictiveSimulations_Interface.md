excerpt: 'In this paper, we first describe our framework to generate predictive simulations of human walking. We then exploit this framework to explore various performance criteria that might explain human walking. We found that a multi-objective performance criterion combining energy and effort considerations can produce physiologically realistic healthy walking patterns.'
