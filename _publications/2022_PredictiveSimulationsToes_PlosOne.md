excerpt: 'This paper describes our work on predictive simulations of human walking. In this study, we first detail our computationally efficient simulation framework, which we then exploit to explore various performance criteria that might explain human walking. We found that a multi-objective performance criterion combining energy and effort considerations can produce physiologically realistic healthy walking patterns, but also that the same criterion predicted the walk-to-run transition and clinical gait deficiencies caused by muscle weakness and prosthesis use.'
