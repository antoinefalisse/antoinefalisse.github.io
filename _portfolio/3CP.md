Physics-based simulations of walking have the potential to support clinical decision-making by predicting the functional outcome of treatments in terms of walking performance. Yet, before this gets materialized, we need to be able to model how mechanical and control impairments affect the walking pattern of children with cerebral palsy. In this project, we worked toward this goal by developing subject-specific models of mechanical (eg, altered muscle-tendon properties) and control (eg, spasticity) impairments affecting children with cerebral palsy. We then used simulations to evaluate the effect of treatments on the walking pattern of a specific child with cerebral palsy.
